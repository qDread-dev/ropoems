    `Life begins at forty, they say, <br>
    But life really began with me when <br>
    illy granddaughter Lynn came my way. <br>
    She was so tiny her first Christmas <br>
    But so much joy she did bring. <br>
    I would cradle her on my knees. <br>
    And a lullaby to her I would sing. <br>
    <br>
    So soon she began to walk and talk, <br>
    And many cute things she did each day. <br>
    One day she thrilled my heart, <br>
    When gran-daddy she did say. <br>
    The fragrance of this one sweet life. <br>
    Will bless my heart always. <br>
    <br>
    On her second Christmas, <br>
    Of all the things that Santa brought, <br>
    One thing captured her mind; <br>
    The little purse her mother brought. <br>
    She would not leave it behind. <br>
    She would hang it on tier little arm, <br>
    And about the house she would go. <br>
    At the end of the hall she would wave bye, <br>
    And to the bedroom she would go, <br>
    Then back again into the den, <br>
    To bless my heart once more. <br>
    <br>
    As time went by, she grew so fast, <br>
    She was so sweet and kind. <br>
    Soon off to kindergarten and to school, To <br>
    train her brilliant mind. <br>
    I thought she would always be around, To <br>
    bless my life all the time. <br>
    But now she's gone, and in my grief, <br>
    With broken heart, I am left behind. <br>
    But, I know that she is with her Lord, <br>
    And I will be with her again sometime. <br>`,

    `The day dawned clear an bright, To me, <br>
    it became my darkest night. From my <br>
    grand-daughter I had to depart, And <br>
    sorrom gripped my broken heart. Why <br>
    in her youth? The questions came, Did <br>
    death, this promising life claim? Why <br>
    so young with dreams so bright, Did <br>
    this precious one take her flight? <br>

    The preacher said, If you try to figure 'why', <br>
    Unanswered questions will darken your sky. <br>
    The Lord does not reveal all He has planned, <br>
    But, out in the future you will understand. <br>
    Yet, now my heart is sad, I miss her so; <br>
    But, she is with her Lord; this I know. <br>
    And we'll be together in a glorious place, <br>
    Redeemed by God's love and saved by His grace. <br>`,

    `I know the Lord blesses our loved ones in heaven, <br>
    And, that they are happy with Him up there. <br>
    But, we are sad and lonely without them, <br>
    Because they are not with us down here. <br>
    <br>
    Some day we will have a happy reunion, <br>
    When we meet them up in the air; <br>
    And we will rejoice together forever, <br>
    With our Lord, and our loved ones up there. <br>
    <br>
    The Lord has prepared a mansion, <br>
    For all that are redeemed by his love, <br>
    And have washed their robes and made them white, <br>
    In the blood of the lamb from above. <br>
    <br>
    We christians should not fear to cross over, <br>
    And leave this old sinful world behind. <br>
    For up there in heaven, there will be nothing, <br>
    To cause us to suffer of to trouble our mind. <br>`,

    `I walked with God this morning. <br>
    Down a beautiful shady lane; <br>
    The blessings were tremendous; <br>
    I praised His holy name. <br>
    <br>
    As we strolled along together, <br>
    His righteous love flooded my soul; <br>
    I was so awed with His mercy to me. <br>
    And that He had made me whole. <br>
    <br>
    The broad way is so inviting. <br>
    But, its pleasures cannot compare, <br>
    To the joy of His glorious fellowship, <br>
    As we strolled along together there. <br>
    <br>
    I have walked with Him in joy; <br>
    I have strolled with Hint in pain. <br>
    I have traveled with Him in sorrow; <br>
    He is sufficient, praise His holy name. <br>`,

    `I thank Thee dear Lord for your blessings, <br>
    Upon me throughout my earthly life; For <br>
    the many good friends and family, And for <br>
    a lovely, wonderful wife. <br>
    <br>
    I thank Thee for home, the greatest institution, <br>
    For man-kind that could possibly be; <br>
    For it is a haven of blessings and rest; <br>
    When each one in the family lives for Thee. <br>
    <br>
    I thank Thee for the privilege of living, <br>
    In the greatest nation on Earth; <br>
    America has afforded the greatest opportunity, <br>
    For all citizens since Thou gave it birth. <br>
    <br>
    A person can choose in America the direction. <br>
    In life that he may wish to go; <br>
    But, the choice is of uttermost importance; <br>
    It will determine success of failure we know. <br>
    <br>
    I thank Thee dear Lord for your blessings, <br>
    That Thou has poured out on me: <br>
    And that when life is over down here, <br>
    You have prepared me a home with Thee. <br>`,

    `There is a name I love to hear, <br>
    I love to sing its worth; <br>
    It is the name of Christ my king. <br>
    Who gave me spiritual birth. <br>
    <br>
    There is another name I love to hear. <br>
    I like to praise her worth; <br>
    It is the name of my mother dear, <br>
    The one who gave me birth. <br>
    <br>
    Praise the name of Christ our king, <br>
    For the mothers of this Earth: It is <br>
    His love that makes her sing. To <br>
    those she has given birth. <br>`,
    `Friends come and friends <br>
    My life is blessed by each I know. <br>
    Some live near, and some live far, <br>
    I cherish them wherever they are. <br>
    <br>
    When duty calls, they must go. <br>
    It saddens my heart; it hurts so. <br>
    There is one thing that I do know, <br>
    They will find friends wherever they go. <br>
    <br>
    Jesus is the best friend on can know: <br>
    He blesses us wherever we go. In the <br>
    Lord's church were one can go, He <br>
    will find new friends, that is so. <br>`,

    `To my family and to my friends, <br>
    This is my message to each of you. <br>
    If on this Earth we are parted, <br>
    I'll have precious memories of you. <br>
    <br>
    You will always be a part of my life, <br>
    For precious memories will never depart. <br>
    The good times we have had together, <br>
    I will cherish them always in inv heart. <br>
    <br>
    Don't you worry if I should leave you, <br>
    The good Master will take care of me; <br>
    And, be waiting when Ile calls you, <br>
    To enjoy His blessings eternally. <br>
    <br>
    Good nights. part us for the moment, <br>
    But they will soon come to an end. <br>
    It will be glorious to be with Jesus, <br>
    And the redeemed, where there is no sin. <br>
    <br>
    I hope my life has been fruitful. And I <br>
    have sowed seed along the way, That <br>
    will bear f'ruit for the Master, Until <br>
    Jesus, my Lord, returns one day. <br>`,

    `I have a friend that lives down the street, <br>
    Ile is always a pleasure to meet and greet. <br>
    He has a lot of trouble with a bad knee; <br>
    And the same thing is crippling me. <br>
    <br>
    It was Satan's lie, that brought this curse; <br>
    We have trusted Jesus, and have had a new birth. <br>
    We may be crippled and hop-around down here, <br>
    But we will not be crippled and hopping up there. <br>
    <br>
    When we see Jesus. we'll be perfect as can be; And <br>
    not hopping around on an old crippled knee. For <br>
    the sacrifice of Jesus, destroyed the curse, That <br>
    old Satan's lie, brought on us upon the Earth.`,

    `What was I, in days gone by?
    <br>
    A sinner in word and deed; <br>
    Lost, damned and much in need. <br>
    I turned my thoughts to the one on high, <br>
    Who loved me so that He drew me nigh. <br>
    He forgave me of my every sin, <br>
    Cleaned me up and took me in. <br>
    <br>
    What was I? That does not count;
    I'm a child of God and live on the mount. <br>
    He fills my life with noble deeds. <br>
    That blesses my fellow man in need. <br>
    1 proclaim His saving grace to all, <br>
    And urge them upon His name to call. <br>
    <br>
    What are you? A sinner in deeds? <br>
    He is able to supply your every need. <br>
    Trust in Him who lives on high: <br>
    Ile will forgive you and draw you nigh. <br>
    The greatest one that you can know, <br>
    Is Jesus Christ who loves you so.<br>`,

    `Though the storms of life beset me, <br>
    And life's billows over me roll; <br>
    I will believe God's Holy Word; <br>
    Trusting Jesus, who saved my soul. <br>
    <br>
    God's Word is my chart and compass, <br>
    Upon life's tempest tossed sea; <br>
    Though I flounder in sin's foamed billows, <br>
    I know God is there to rescue me. <br>
    <br>
    God's word is the towering light- <br>
    house, Lighting every treacherous <br>
    shoal: Guiding my battered, life-boat. <br>
    To the heaven of rest, my goal. <br>
    <br>
    Dear tempest tossed, sin-sick, sinner, <br>
    Does Satan's billows over you roll? <br>
    Trust Jesus, who owns the light-house; <br>
    He will save your sin tossed soul. <br>
    <br>
    Jesus is God's only chosen captain,
    He has charted each sin's reef and shoal, <br>
    Only lie can pilot God's life-boat. <br>
    And rescue your precious soul. <br>
    <br>
    Jesus resisted all Satan had to offer, <br>
    Death's billows did over Him roll; <br>
    Which He conquered, by glorious resurrection. <br>
    For you and me, to save our souls. <br>`,

    `Your cheerful smiles are contagious, <br>
    They bless others along the way. The <br>
    sunshine of God's love, Radiates <br>
    from your lives each day. <br>
    <br>
    I wonder why you are not gloomy, <br>
    With the burdens you must bear. <br>
    you are often confined to bed. And <br>
    always to an old wheel chair. <br>
    <br>
    Yet, you are never complaining. <br>
    About the burdens you have to bear; <br>
    But, you are always thankful, <br>
    For God's blessings you have to share. <br>
    <br>
    Those of us who are healthy, <br>
    And have energy to spare, <br>
    Are the ones who should be happy, <br>
    And spreading sunshine everywhere. <br>
    <br>
    But, old Satan often deceives us He <br>
    magnifies the pleasures of sin; But, <br>
    he never mentions the suffering. Sin <br>
    causes us in the end.`,
    
    `Y-all-come, is too often a one way street; <br>
    When they come, is the only time you meet. It <br>
    is the same distance from your place there, <br>
    As it is from their place to yours, for sure. <br>
    <br>
    Go visit your friends before they are dead; <br>
    Don't even wait until they are sick and in bed; <br>
    A visit to the well is a blessing you know; But <br>
    a visit to the dead is a vain show. <br>
    <br>
    He meant a. tot to me, a visitor said; <br>
    But, it was too late, he was already dead. <br>
    This often brings grief, and makes one sad, <br>
    And ashamed, that they waited until he was dead. <br>
    <br>
    Go visit the lonely and needy, that you know; The <br>
    Lord will bless you and them, if you go. While <br>
    your friends live, go show the your love, And the <br>
    Lord will pour out blessings from above.`,

    `Live as you would if Jesus was watching over. <br>
    Live as you would if tomorrow, life would be o'r. <br>
    Live as you would if Jesus lived in your home. <br>
    Live as you would if Jesus watched you roam, <br>
    Live as you would if Jesus heard your every word. <br>
    Live as you would if Jesus your thoughts heard. <br>
    Live as you would if Jesus your offerings took. <br>
    Live as you would if Jesus searched your every look. <br>
    Live as you would if Jesus from the pulpit spoke. <br>
    Live as you would if Jesus a service record wrote.`,

    `Before you launch out on life's journey, <br>
    Take a good look at God's holy word; <br>
    It tells of the two ways that you can travel, <br>
    And what you will find at the end of the road. <br>
    <br>
    The broad way, to this life, is inviting, <br>
    With all the earthly pleasures it displays; <br>
    It does not warn you of the tragedies, Or <br>
    the disaster at the end of the way. <br>
    <br>
    Sexual sins and Godless worldly pleasure, <br>
    Such alcohol and dope, <br>
    Will destroy your real happiness; <br>
    And rob you of all decency, and hope. <br>
    <br>
    God's righteous way may not be enticing, <br>
    But it is, by far, the best way to go. You <br>
    will have real joy, as you travel on, And <br>
    it will end where you want to go.`,

    `Dear Lord, there are so many ways to go,  <br>
    Please, choose the right one for me. Not  <br>
    the one that is the less difficult; Lord,  <br>
    but the one that will honor Thee.  <br>
    <br>
    As 1 travel on in life's journey, I  <br>
    want it to ahvays be with Thee. Bless  <br>
    inc with Thy precious salvation; So I  <br>
    can lire eternally with Thee,`,

    `It is the set of the sail, <br>
    Not the direction of the gale, <br>
    That determines where you'll embark. <br>
    <br>
    Don't ever lower the mast: <br>
    But stick to your task, <br>
    Whenever adverse winds blow. <br>
    <br>
    With Captain. Jesus in charge, <br>
    You will always go forward, <br>
    Until you have reached your goal.`,

    `What kind of a church would my church be. <br>
    If all the members were just like me? This <br>
    is a serious question, dear reader; What <br>
    have you done as a church leader? <br>
    <br>
    How many services would your church have had. <br>
    Or, would everyone been absent instead? <br>
    How many visits would have been made. <br>
    Or, would the sick in loneliness laid? <br>
    <br>
    Just how much Gospel would have been preached; <br>
    And, how many souls would have been reached? <br>
    How much money would have been given, <br>
    For the ongoing of the kingdom of heaven? <br>
    <br>
    Just how far would the mission money go. <br>
    Or, would the lost world remain in woe? <br>
    How many of the hungry would have been fed. <br>
    Or, would they be starving, sick or dead?`,
    
    `The church needs more good firemen, <br>
    With concern for their sinful kin, <br>
    To shovel in the holy coal. <br>
    That makes the wheels of Zion roll. <br>
    To blow the Gospel whistle sound, <br>
    So, it can be heard the world around. <br>
    No brakemen needed, to screech the brake, <br>
    What a horrible sound such a stop would make. <br>
    Rescue is urgent, men can lose their souls, <br>
    Unless the Gospel reaches God's goal. <br>
    A rich reward is offered thee. <br>
    If a faithful christian fireman you will be.`,

    `I can't, may be a lie; <br>
    You don't know until you try. <br>
    <br>
    I won't, is rebellion; <br>
    It is a sin against, heaven. <br>
    <br>
    I am afraid, is a coward; <br>
    It keeps us from going forward. <br>
    <br>
    I will try, is willingness; <br>
    Your efforts will be blessed. <br>
    <br>
    I will do my best, is success; <br>
    For the Lord will do the rest.`,

    `Why do you ask me, That is the matter? <br>
    When you see the busy whirl, <br>
    Of people rushing after the pleasures, <br>
    Of this Godless, sinful world. <br>
    I know something awful is the matter. <br>
    Everyone knows something is bad wrong, <br>
    When so many turn away from Bible study, <br>
    Prayer, worship and sacred song. <br>
    <br><br>
    I am sure I know what is the matter, But, <br>
    it is not popular with the crowd. Jesus <br>
    Christ is not their Lord and Master, But, <br>
    many would deny it long and loud. Did <br>
    you not see us at church last Easter, As <br>
    we mingled with all that crowd? Too, the <br>
    preacher was so popular, When their <br>
    loved one wore a shroud.<br>
    <br><br>
    There are many other things the matter, <br>
    Such as gaining wealth, just to hold: And <br>
    not enough love for Jesus Christ, Or <br>
    concern for the lost outside the fold. <br>
    Things are not going to be any better, As <br>
    long as church-folk neglect God's work, <br>
    And run after Godless, worldly pleasures, <br>
    Instead of worshiping the Lord in church.`,

    `The picture the artist painted. <br>
    Made my heart sad and sore; <br>
    Satan asleep by the steeple, <br>
    Above the Lord's church house door. <br>
    <br>
    He did not have to worry„ <br>
    About the Lord's work being done; <br>
    Only a few of the church members, <br>
    God's work was carrying on. <br>
    <br>
    The majority of the church members, <br>
    Seemed to think they have it made; <br>
    They do not serve the Master; <br>
    They just loll about in the shade. <br>
    <br>
    Surely they are not ignorant, <br>
    Of the teaching of God's word; <br>
    Jesus said, If you lore Me, <br>
    you will obey and keep M word.. <br>
    <br>
    Go ye and preach the Gospel.  <br>
    That I hare given unto you:  <br>
    It is the power of God's salvation,  <br>
    To all who trust and believe it is true.  <br>
    <br>
    Aot all that say, Lord, Lord, <br>
    Shall enter into My holy rest; <br>
    But, those who love and serve Me, <br>
    Shall forever, with Me be blessed. <br>
    <br>

    This is my message to you. <br>
    Repent and return to active service, <br>
    Before the Lord judges you.`,

    `Dear christians, why did you not help us? <br>
    You live in a land of plenty and in luxury. <br>
    You knew millions of us were destitute; <br>
    Driven from our homes beyond the sea. <br>
    We were homeless, starving, sick and dying, <br>
    As was plainly shown on your T.V. <br>
    Dear christians, why did you not help us? <br>
    You had plenty for us too, you see. <br>
    <br>
    You Americans are blessed beyond measure, <br>
    You are blessed by the dear Savior's love. <br>
    You educate and train your children, <br>
    And point them to the Savior above. <br>
    What if your child was sick and starving, <br>
    And all vou could do was to watch it die. <br>
    Would you not want some one to help you, <br>
    And show God's love who lives on high? <br>
    <br>
    You say that you are christians, <br>
    And are seeking, on Earth. God's will to do. <br>
    Yet, you give little to the destitute; <br>
    Is that letting God's love flow through you? <br>
    With a pathetic cry, millions are pleading, <br>
    For your help, as you can plainly see. <br>
    You cannot afford to let them suffer, <br>
    Starve, die, in sin and misery. <br>
    <br>
    If you knew that Jesus was starving., <br>
    With outstretched hands that you could see, <br>
    Would you not share with Him gladly, <br>
    To help such a wonderful Savior as He? <br>
    Yet, all you give to help the needy. <br>
    Jesus will say, You did it unto Me.. <br>
    Please, dear christians, do not fail us, <br>
    Your generous gift will bless you an me.`,

    `I sought for God in business; <br>
    I found much dishonesty there. <br>
    I sought for God in labor; <br>
    I found many workmen unfair. <br>
    <br>
    I sought for God in government: I <br>
    found many laws unfair. <br>
    I sought for God in democracy, I <br>
    found Him excluded out there. <br>
    <br>
    I sought for God in capitalism; <br>
    I found that greed ruled everywhere. <br>
    I sought for God in communism; <br>
    I found nations in despair. <br>
    <br>
    I sought for God in society; <br>
    I found but little virtue there. <br>
    I sought for God in pleasure; <br>
    I found only emptiness and despair. <br>
    I sought for God in the city: <br>
    I found the sin sick in despair. <br>
    <br>
    I sought God in the country; <br>
    I found the sin wrecked even there. <br>
    I sought for God in nature; <br>
    I found His beauty everywhere. <br>
    I sought for God in the heavens; <br>
    I found His glory declared there. <br>
    <br>
    I sought for God in the church; <br>
    I found His righteousness there. <br>
    I sought for God to come into my heart; <br>
    I found peace, for He now dwells there.`,

    `As we travel the road with Jesus, <br>

    Trying to secure forever His doom. <br>

    As we travel the road with Jesus. <br>
    We see Him alive forever more; <br>
    When the disciples caught nothing, <br>
    Ile fed them upon Galilee's shore. <br>

    As we travel the road with Jesus. We <br>
    saw how He lived and lie died; And <br>

    As Mr. Green was happily going on his way.<br>
    <br>
    Why are you so sad, Mr. Silver, my friend?<br>
    It is because I have come to my journey's end,<br>
    <br>
    Evidently, my master has never read,<br>
    That a loving God provides his daily bread.<br>
    <br>
    He has imprisoned me in this bank's ward,<br>
    I, the tenth one, that belongs to the Lord.<br>

    I am so sorry for you, Mr. Silver. my friend;<br>
    My Master is sending me on an enchanting errand!<br>
    <br>
    I am to travel over this land and across the sea.<br>
    Sharing tile Gospel with lost souls wher'er they be,<br>
    <br>
    Oh, Mr. Green, you have such a marvelous task;<br>
    My master should realize his earthly life won't last.<br>
    <br>
    Go on, and serve your Master in a glorious way.<br>
    But, alas. in this bank vault I'm (loomed to stay,<br>
    <br>
    Until my master's life has wasted away;<br>
    And I canker, and rust, and to dust decay.<br>

    If, in death. you met Jesus, while traveling life's way?`,

    For I want to be of help to you.<br>
    <br>
    The soldier said, You are a fine young<br>
    man, You'll be a success in anything you<br>

    `I wonder if Jesus had a little fluffy dog;<br>
    That was as loving and cuddly as mine.<br>
    No matter how others treated him;<br>
    Fluff, would have been loving, cuddly and kind.<br>
    <br>
    When the sorrows of Gethsemane was upon him;<br>
    And all of His disciples were sleepy heads.<br>
    Fluff, would have cuddled near to comfort;<br>
    When, in agony, His sweat dropped down red.<br>
    <br>
    When Jesus prayed, not My will, but Thine.<br>
    He knew that. He must die in our place.<br>
    Ns He agonized there before His Father;<br>
    Little Fluff, would have licked IIis face.<br>
    <br>
    If all that claim to be christians:<br>
    Were as faithful, as my little Fluff.<br>
    God's Gospel plan of salvation would be<br>

    When we become inactive and useless, And<br>
    our hand lie helpless by our side.<br>
    <br>
    Earthly things will no longer be important,<br>
    For no money in our hands can we hold.<br>
    Our stocks and bonds will offer no security,<br>
    From the reaper's heavy breath, o' so cold.<br>
    <br>
    Our diamonds will loose all their sparkle;<br>
    And we'll care nothing for glittering gold.<br>
    We will have to release all our bank notes,<br>
    And all the deeds to the properties we hold.<br>
    <br>
    Ultimately, nothing will really matter, When<br>
    our caskets have been marked sold, We will<br>
    want only Jesus, the Good Shepherd, To<br>
    welcome us into God's sheep fold.`,

    `There was a healthy man in our town,<br>
    Who was blessed with great wealth;<br>
    But he wasted it on cigarettes,<br>
    Until he lost his precious health.<br>
    <br>
    Then the people in our town,<br>
    Watched him wheeze, cough, and groan.<br>
    What a shame that he had to suffer so,<br>
    Until his precious life was gone.`,
    
    `My brother committed suicide with cigarettes;<br>
    He said, If I smoke they kill me<br>
    He smoked and died at 23; a victim of T.B.<br>
    A gun would have saved him a lot of misery.<br>
    <br>
    He was the healthiest child in our clan; If<br>
    he had cared for himself as lie should, He<br>
    could have been a strong, healthy man,<br>
    Lived a long life, and done much good.`,

    We all know that God's word is<br>
    If by it we all would abide.<br>
    We would serve the Lord in harmony,<br>
    And walk as brothers should, side by side„<br>
    <br>
    Paul and Barnabas had their differences,<br>
    But it did not hinder God's holy word.<br>
    They organized two mission bands.<br>
    And established more churches for the Lord.<br>
    <br>
    Whether the other fellow believes the Bible,<br>
    That every word of it is true.<br>
    We are conunanded to tell every lost soul,<br>
    Jesus Christ died to save you.<br>
    <br>
    We had better forget our differences,<br>
    For there are millions lost without the Lord;<br>
    That will suffer in hell forever.<br>
    Unless we proclaim to them God's holy word.<br>
    <br>
    I would not call myself a Southern Baptist,<br>
    If I did not believe in anything they do;<br>
    And, did not support its mission causes,<br>
    That are being supported by me and you.`,

    `Football is a game that is played every fall;<br>
    A winning team must get on the ball.<br>
    They must kick, pass, and carry the ball.<br>
    And stop the other team when they have the ball.<br>
    <br>
    If they do not win the fans blame the coach,<br>
    They say he's the reason and make him the goat.<br>
    The coach never does get to carry the ball;<br>
    Never the less, he is blamed for the team's downfall.<br>
    <br>
    The football is not heavy, my coach would say,<br>
    Anyone can carry it if the line opens up a way.<br>
    If a hole is opened up by the men on the line,<br>
    So the runner can get through, he will do fine.<br>
    <br>
    If you want a winning team, players, it is up to<br>
    you, To follow the instructions the coach gives to<br>
    you. If you'll do the job just like the coach said,<br>
    You'll win many games and come out way ahead.`,

    If vou vets would vaccinate wild animals and bats;<br>
    You would not need to vaccinate us cats.<br>

    For dogs, foxes, 'coons, skunks and bats<br>
    Are much more prone to rabies than cats.<br>

    No record at the courthouse it is sad.<br>

    As loved ones and friends mourned her passing, they said,<br>
